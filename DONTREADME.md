# The Misleading Introduction to APCA

User xi (Tobias Bengfort) created the parent repo, which is unfortunately filled with misconceptions and spurious assertions regarding readability, human perception of contrast, and APCA. Many things written at the parent repo are in error, misleading, false, or a complete misunderstanding.

The "analysis" page corrupts the math in a beligerant attempt to crudely and incorrectly reverse-engineer APCA, and is making unauthorized claims and false assertions. It's pretty gross, actually. This fork is intended to set the record straight.

## *The Truth Is Clear*
Anyone with actual experience and knowledge in the field of vision science will clearly recognize the problems with Bengfort's faux analysis. My concern is that xi is using complicated yet meaningless math to support his spurious assertions, which could create confusion and misunderstanding among many. On further investigation there appears the intention, by certain members of the small group of corporate obstructionists, to use Bengfort's repo as a reference furthering the direct interference with the development and continued research of visual readability.

WCAG 2.x contrast SCs are well known to be wrong, we have proven that they cause more problems than they claim to solve. If somebody is objecting to changing WCAG 2.x contrast, ask yourself what their actual underlying motivation is. Most of these objections appear to be coming from within certain corporations who have a vested interest in the status quo.

### Readability is too important to society at large to allow such obstruction to continue.
