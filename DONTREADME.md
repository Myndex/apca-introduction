# The misleading introduction to APCA

User xi created this repo, with some unfortunate misconceptions and spurious assertions regarding APCA. Many things written at the original are in error or misleading, or a complete misunderstanding. And the analysis page corrupts the math in a beligerant attempt to crudely and incompletely reverse engineer APCA. It's pretty gross, actually. This fork is intended to set the record straight.
